# Meet Matz

The creator of Ruby is [Yukihiro Matsumoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto). He says: "Ruby is designed to make programmers happy." That is one of the reasons why Rubyists promote MINASWAN - "Matz is Nice And So We Are Nice". As a Rubyist it is now your job to continue to promote positivity and goodwill in the Ruby community.

A few other Rubyists of note:

* [David Heinemeier Hansson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Heinemeier_Hansson) - the creator of Ruby on Rails. He also drives race-cars and has a lot of opinions. He shares some of them here [Signal vs. Noise](https://signalvnoise.com/writers/dhh). 
* Sandi Metz - Famous for writing the [POODR book](http://www.poodr.com/) and for inspirational wisdom such as "Grit, get things done. It is the act of doing that has value, not whatever it is the world tells you once you're finished" and "You'll never be as stupid as you are right now." Words to live by.
* [why the lucky stiff](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff) - The source behind [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0) and writer of [Why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/)
